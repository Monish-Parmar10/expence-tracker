  We chose the problem of managing expenses because many teenagers and adults struggle to track their daily spending. A simple, smart expense tracker can help users stay organized, save money, and build better financial habits.

Key Challenges :
Making the expense tracker simple and user-friendly for all age groups.
Storing and displaying data properly using local storage.

Brainstorming & Pivots:

We refined the design to make it clean, modern, and easy to navigate after feedback from team discussions.
