🚀 Project Title

📌 Problem Statement
Problem Statement 1 - Weave AI magic with Groq.
(To build a simple, smart web-based application where users can easily track their expenses, manage their spending, and develop better financial habits.)

🎯 Objective
Many teenagers and adults struggle with managing their daily expenses effectively, leading to poor financial habits and lack of savings awareness.(mostly use by college students and teenagers)


Your Approach:

Key Challenges :
Making the expense tracker simple and user-friendly for all age groups.
Storing and displaying data properly using local storage.

Brainstorming & Pivots:

We discussed different ideas like building a budgeting app or reminder tool, but finally focused on an expense tracker.
We refined the design to make it clean, modern, and easy to navigate after feedback from team discussions.
